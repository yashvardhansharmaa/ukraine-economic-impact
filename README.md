## Project Summary

This project aims to summarize, replicate, and extend parts of the paper titled "The Economic Costs of Hybrid Wars: The Case of Ukraine" by Bluszcz and Valente (2020). The objective is to provide more robust conclusions about the economic impact of the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine on Ukraine's GDP per capita (GDPpc) through three primary efforts:

1. **Extending the post-treatment period**: The analysis examines the long-term effects of the invasion by extending the post-treatment period to 2021, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the economic impact.

2. **Rigorous criteria for the donor pool**: The project proposes more rigorous criteria for selecting donor countries, accounting for potential biases and confounds. By excluding five donor countries that experienced conflicts that could lead to biased estimates, the analysis aims to improve the reliability of the results.

3. **Adjusting predictor weights**: The project explores the impact of adjusting the weights of predictors used in the analysis, aiming to achieve better matching and accuracy in estimating the causal effect.

## Project Extensions

The project introduces three extensions to the original analysis by Bluszcz and Valente (2020), addressing limitations and improving upon the findings:

1. **Extension 1: Updated data and extended post-treatment period**

The analysis extends the post-treatment period from 2013-17 with a 2011$ base rate to 2013-21 with a 2017$ base rate. The results indicate an increased difference in GDPpc between Ukraine and the synthetic control unit in the extended post-treatment period. The average treatment effect for 2013-17 with 2017$ is -3091.5$, and for 2013-21 with 2017$ is -4031.38$.

2. **Extension 2: Improved donor pool criteria**

By excluding five donor countries that might introduce bias into the estimates, the project achieves better outcome balance on the "Inflation" predictor. The treatment effect is recalculated as -4140 USD$2017, suggesting that the previous findings by Bluszcz and Valente (2020) might have underestimated the causal effect due to a less restrictive donor pool.

3. **Extension 3: Predictor balance improvement**

Initially, the project aims to manually adjust predictor weights and introduce special predictors to improve balance. However, after implementing the improved donor pool criteria in Extension 2, it is found that such modifications are unnecessary.
